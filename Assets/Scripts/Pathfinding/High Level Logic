1) Nodes are determined
-- Nodes are at every mesh? triangle? vertices?
-- a) Determine if node is walkable
-- b) Determine if node's position
-- c) Need Level Generator to determine if vertice is walkable
----- 1) if tree, if bush, if pole, if barrel, if wall, etc.
------ REQUIRES: Vertice object

2) Set up a bunch of Nodes
3) Pathfinding involves traversing through a bunch of nodes
4) Every time a flock arrives at a waypoint, recalculate the path to the player
--- Can be optimized, keep track of NumOfNodesTraversed and every time a flock arrives at NumOfWaypoints / 2, recalculate path
